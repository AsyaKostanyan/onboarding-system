  <h2>Monetary Policy and the Evolution of Modern Central Banking</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Central Bank of Armenia’s Onboarding Platform for new Board Members.
    This platform introduces you to the evolution of modern monetary policy — from its
    global intellectual roots to Armenia’s current framework, known as the
    <strong>Prudent Risk Management Approach to Price Stability (PRMAPS)</strong>, also referred to as
    <strong>FPAS Mark II</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Designed for newly appointed members of the CBA Board, the platform provides a
    structured and intellectually engaging journey through the principles and practice of
    central banking. It explains how economic thinking evolved through decades of global
    experience, culminating in the CBA’s modern approach to policy under uncertainty.

  <h2>Program Format</h2>
  <p>
    The onboarding consists of <strong>21 concise videos</strong> (each 5–10 minutes long),
    each accompanied by a short explanatory note, background readings, and
    Armenia-specific insights. The tone is conceptual and intuitive — focused on building
    shared understanding and policy intuition rather than technical mastery.

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this platform is to build a shared mindset for decision-making under
    uncertainty. Understanding monetary policy at the CBA is not just about economics —
    it is about strengthening collective judgment, transparency, and credibility in pursuit
    of price stability.
