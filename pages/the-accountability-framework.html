        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is <strong>Susanna Grigoryan</strong>. I’m a Level One student at the Global
          Forecasting School and an economist at the Central Bank of Armenia.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this lesson, we explore how <strong>FPAS Mark II strengthens credibility through a robust
          Accountability Framework</strong>. Accountability is a defining feature of FPAS Mark II. It ensures
          that monetary policy decisions are transparent, disciplined, and aligned with the mandate of
          price stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Accountability Framework provides structure for how the Central Bank of Armenia evaluates
          policy outcomes, reviews internal processes, and communicates the results to the public. Under
          FPAS Mark II, accountability is <strong>continuous, not episodic</strong>—it is built directly into the
          29-day policy cycle and the Bank’s communication strategy.
        </p>

      <!-- SECTION 1: ACCOUNTABILITY AND CREDIBILITY -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>1. Accountability and Credibility under FPAS Mark II</h2>
        <p>
          Accountability reinforces credibility by showing that policy decisions are evaluated against
          <strong>clear objectives</strong>, that mistakes are acknowledged and addressed, and that processes
          improve over time. Under FPAS Mark II, accountability is not a one-off exercise; it is
          <strong>embedded in every policy round</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework ensures that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>decisions are judged relative to the inflation target and broader mandate,</li>
          <li>uncertainty is explicitly recognized through a least-regrets perspective, and</li>
          <li>policy performance is reviewed consistently across time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this way, accountability becomes a core channel through which FPAS Mark II helps the
          Central Bank of Armenia build and maintain public trust.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 2: ASSESSING POLICY OUTCOMES -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>2. Assessing Policy Outcomes within an Uncertain World</h2>
        <p>
          Policy success is assessed in a world of uncertainty. Rather than rigid scorekeeping against a
          single forecast, FPAS Mark II emphasizes evaluating outcomes within a <strong>least-regrets,
          uncertainty-aware framework</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Accountability Framework looks at:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Inflation relative to the target</strong>, including measures of underlying inflation
            that filter out temporary noise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real activity and labor market indicators</strong>, capturing economic slack and
            employment conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial stability metrics</strong>, including credit growth, asset prices, and
            balance-sheet risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>External and geopolitical risks</strong>, which can materially affect inflation and
            output paths.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By assessing policy outcomes across these dimensions, the Bank can judge whether its
          decisions were prudent and consistent with the least-regrets mindset.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 3: INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEARNING -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>3. Internal Accountability and Institutional Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Internal accountability is strengthened through a series of structured <strong>post-round
          reviews</strong> and diagnostics that are integrated into the 29-day policy cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Forecast performance assessment</strong> — comparing projections to outcomes and
            identifying systematic biases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario effectiveness evaluations</strong> — examining whether the scenarios used
            for decision-making captured the most relevant risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credibility and expectations analysis</strong> — assessing how well inflation and
            policy expectations are anchored.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication quality checks</strong> — reviewing whether internal and external
            messages were clear, coherent, and aligned with the framework.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These internal reviews build <strong>institutional memory</strong> and reinforce learning across
          policy rounds, making the framework stronger over time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 4: EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>4. External Accountability and Democratic Legitimacy</h2>
        <p>
          Transparency also requires <strong>external accountability</strong>. Under FPAS Mark II, the Central
          Bank of Armenia provides the public and stakeholders with a comprehensive view of decisions,
          reasoning, and outcomes through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>Monetary Policy Report</strong>, which presents forecasts, scenarios, and the
            analytical backbone of policy decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>Executive Statement</strong>, summarizing the decision and its main justifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attributed minutes</strong>, which reflect the range of views on the Board and how
            individual members interpreted the balance of risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Press conferences</strong>, where the Board and staff explain decisions and respond
            to questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Annual reviews</strong> of monetary policy performance and communication.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          External accountability reinforces <strong>democratic legitimacy</strong> and allows experts,
          analysts, and the public to scrutinize policy decisions under FPAS Mark II.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 5: ACCOUNTABILITY AS CULTURE -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>5. Accountability as Culture, Not Just Procedure</h2>
        <p>
          Accountability in FPAS Mark II is not merely procedural—it is <strong>cultural</strong>. The framework
          promotes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Humility in decision-making</strong> — recognizing that uncertainty is unavoidable
            and that mistakes can occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Openness about uncertainty</strong> — being clear about what is known and unknown,
            and how risks are being managed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Willingness to revise assessments</strong> — updating views and scenarios when new
            information arrives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear communication of risks</strong> — explaining the balance of risks and the
            least-regrets logic behind decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When accountability is part of the culture, it becomes a <strong>source of strength</strong> rather
          than a constraint. It supports better decisions, stronger communication, and more effective
          policy transmission.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 6: CONCLUSION -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>6. Conclusion: Accountability as a Pillar of FPAS Mark II</h2>
        <p>
          The Accountability Framework of FPAS Mark II ensures that the Central Bank of Armenia remains
          <strong>transparent, credible, and aligned with its mandate</strong>. By integrating accountability
          into analysis, communication, and institutional learning, the Bank strengthens public trust
          and enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy.
        </p>
