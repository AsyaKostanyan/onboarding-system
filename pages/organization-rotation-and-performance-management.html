        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>
          Under <strong>FPAS Mark II</strong>, good monetary policy is not only about models and scenarios—
          it is also about how people are organized, how they rotate across roles, and how their
          performance is managed and developed over time. A well-designed organizational
          structure ensures that the central bank’s scarce human capital is used efficiently to
          support the <strong>least-regrets, scenario-based policy framework</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This session explains how the roles of the <strong>Chief Economist</strong>, the
          <strong>Director of Operations</strong>, <strong>Group Managers</strong>, projection round teams,
          and <strong>Board Coordinators</strong> fit together. It also shows how a structured
          <strong>rotation system</strong> across teams and roles helps sustain the FPAS processes,
          supports learning-by-doing, and strengthens motivation, collaboration, and productivity.

      <!-- SECTION 1: LEADERSHIP ROLES -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>1. Leadership Roles in FPAS Mark II</h2>

        <h3>Chief Economist</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Chief Economist</strong> serves as the head of the Monetary Policy Department (MPD)
          and is responsible for ensuring that all of the central bank’s analytical and human
          resources are used efficiently to support <strong>FPAS Mark II</strong>. The Chief Economist:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>leads all major projects and processes in the MPD;</li>
          <li>on a rotational basis, coordinates and leads one of the quarterly projection rounds;</li>
          <li>acts as a key liaison between the Board and the staff;</li>
          <li>gives direction to the Director of Operations and Group Managers on human capital issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This role requires <strong>unquestionable macroeconomic expertise</strong> and thought leadership
          in monetary policy, combined with a strong ability to <strong>manage, inspire, and mentor</strong>
          staff across the department.
        </p>

        <h3>Director of Operations / Deputy Head of MPD</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Director of Operations (DO)</strong>, or Deputy Head of the MPD, is a skilled
          macroeconomist who focuses on the <strong>operational backbone</strong> of the department. The DO:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>manages the team’s assets (models, documentation, data, tools);</li>
          <li>oversees organizational aspects of human capital (resource allocation, testing, feedback);</li>
          <li>develops platforms for knowledge sharing (brown bags, seminars, workshops, conferences);</li>
          <li>coordinates MPD with other departments (IT, HR, statistics, research, financial stability, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In many ways, the DO represents the “best” of the Group Managers—combining strong
          technical skills with excellent organizational and people-management abilities, supported
          by an assistant and/or a dedicated HR Manager.
        </p>

        <h3>Group Managers</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Group Managers</strong> are advanced macroeconomists with expert mastery of the core
          competencies and higher levels of certification. More important than their technical skills,
          however, is their role in <strong>human capital development</strong>. A manager, in this sense, is
          not just a “boss” or the best modeler, but someone who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>leads people, guides their development, and helps them grow;</li>
          <li>coaches staff through the FPAS process and backs them up in producing FPAS Mark II outputs;</li>
          <li>helps manage resources across teams to maximize overall effectiveness;</li>
          <li>provides ongoing feedback and completes performance reviews (APRs);</li>
          <li>understands HR rules and keeps job responsibilities up to date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Group Managers also perform regular macroeconomic work, but their distinct contribution
          is to <strong>build capacity</strong>, foster collaboration, and sustain the FPAS culture over time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 2: TEAM-BASED STRUCTURE AND ROTATION -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>2. Team-Based Structure and Rotation in Projection Rounds</h2>
        <p>
          An important organizational feature of FPAS Mark II is the <strong>team-based structure</strong>
          during the projection rounds. The MPD is divided into four teams of six macroeconomists.
          In each projection round:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Two teams</strong> are actively involved:
            <ul>
              <li>one team does the “heavy lifting” of building and running the scenarios;</li>
              <li>the second team plays a supporting role, providing tactical and technical support.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Two teams</strong> are less heavily involved in the round and focus on
            “preparing for the future”: trailblazing, research, toolkit development, and special analysis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During each round, one member of the leading team serves as the
          <strong>Projection Round Team Lead</strong> on a rotational basis. The Team Lead:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>acts as the thought leader for the team during that specific round;</li>
          <li>guides the team through the day-to-day projection process;</li>
          <li>helps prepare materials and presents content to the Board;</li>
          <li>receives support from the Chief Economist as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This role is distinct from the Group Manager role: the Team Lead is responsible for
          <strong>intellectual leadership during the round</strong>, whereas Group Managers focus on broader
          human capital and resource management across rounds.
        </p>

        <h3>Allocation of Tasks within the Leading Team</h3>
        <p>
          Within the six-person team that leads the projection round, responsibilities can be organized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Four macroeconomists</strong> focus on the case scenarios
            (Case A, Case B, and when needed, Case X/Y):
            <ul>
              <li>they take full ownership of building and refining these scenarios;</li>
              <li>they draft the parts of the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) related to their scenarios;</li>
              <li>they assist the Chief Economist / Projection Coordinator in preparing the Board presentation and remaining MPR sections.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Two macroeconomists</strong> serve as <strong>Board Coordinators</strong>,
            providing direct support to Board members throughout the round (see next section).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The objective is to ensure that the MPR can be published almost concurrently with the
          policy decision, with scenarios, narratives, and risk assessments fully aligned.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 3: ROLE OF BOARD COORDINATORS -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>3. Role of Board Coordinators</h2>
        <p>
          At the start of each projection round, beginning from the <strong>kick-off meeting</strong>,
          two members of the leading MPD team are designated as <strong>Board Coordinators</strong>.
          They are typically highly skilled macroeconomists with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>at least Level 2 GFS knowledge and skills;</li>
          <li>strong modeling abilities and policy intuition;</li>
          <li>excellent communication skills;</li>
          <li>strong time and resource management capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Their core task is to work closely with Board members to translate their ideas, concerns,
          and views into clear narratives and inputs for the projection process.
        </p>

        <h3>From Board Discussions to One-Pagers</h3>
        <p>
          Following the kick-off meeting and subsequent formal and informal discussions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coordinators help Board members articulate their views on:
            <ul>
              <li>where the economy is today,</li>
              <li>what is driving the economy,</li>
              <li>what policy responses may be required to achieve the central bank’s objectives.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            These views are distilled into concise <strong>one-page narratives</strong> (“one-pagers”)
            that capture the Board members’ preferred “essential ingredients” for scenarios and policy paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            In countries where English is not the only official language, the coordinators
            draft these one-pagers in both English and the national language(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            The one-pagers are then submitted to the Chief Economist / Projection Coordinator
            and the rest of the projection team as structured inputs for scenario design.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this way, Board views are systematically integrated into the FPAS Mark II process,
          strengthening both <strong>ownership</strong> and <strong>accountability</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 4: ROTATION, LEARNING, AND PERFORMANCE -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>4. Rotation after the Projection Round and Performance Management</h2>
        <p>
          Once the case scenarios are finalized, the policy decision is taken, and the MPR is
          published, the projection round is considered complete and the teams prepare for
          the next policy cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key feature of FPAS Mark II is the <strong>rotation system</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The team that served as <strong>“back-up”</strong> in the previous round becomes the
            <strong>leading team</strong> in the next projection round.
          </li>
          <li>
            This team takes a more proactive role in the <strong>weekly macroeconomic monitoring meetings</strong>,
            preparing key analysis and narratives for the next kick-off meeting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over the course of a year, each of the four MPD teams:
            <ul>
              <li>leads the projection round once,</li>
              <li>serves as back-up once,</li>
              <li>and spends two quarters focusing on “preparing for the future” (research, toolkit, and current analysis).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This rotation reinforces <strong>sustainability</strong> of the FPAS processes, avoids burnout,
          and creates repeated opportunities for staff to learn, lead, and innovate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance management under this structure is not about narrow metrics or
          short-term outputs. Instead, it focuses on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>continuous learning and improvement across rounds;</li>
          <li>collaboration and knowledge sharing within and across teams;</li>
          <li>progress along certification and competency ladders;</li>
          <li>constructive feedback from managers and peers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this way, <strong>organization, rotation, and performance management</strong> become
          powerful tools for building a resilient, high-performing FPAS Mark II team that
          can support the Board in making better, more transparent policy decisions.
