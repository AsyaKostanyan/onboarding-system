      <!-- NOTE / INTRO BASED ON SCRIPT -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is <strong>Susanna Grigoryan</strong>. I’m a recent staff member in the
          Monetary Policy Department at the Central Bank of Armenia and a Level One student
          at the Global Forecasting School.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this lesson, we explore how <strong>FPAS Mark II strengthens transparency as a core
          element of credible monetary policy</strong>. Transparency under FPAS Mark II helps anchor
          expectations, reduce uncertainty, and support clearer policy transmission. It lowers
          the risk of misinterpretation and helps markets internalize the central bank’s risk
          assessment rather than relying on speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under FPAS Mark II, transparency is <strong>embedded throughout the framework</strong>:
          in scenario design, communication, minutes, forecasts, and post-round assessments.
          It is not cosmetic. It is foundational to how we explain our decisions and how we
          earn and maintain credibility over time.

      <!-- SECTION 1: WHY TRANSPARENCY MATTERS UNDER FPAS MARK II -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>1. Why Transparency Matters under FPAS Mark II</h2>
        <p>
          Transparency under FPAS Mark II plays a central role in <strong>anchoring expectations</strong>,
          <strong>reducing uncertainty</strong>, and <strong>strengthening policy transmission</strong>.
          By clearly explaining our framework and decisions, we lower the risk that markets
          misinterpret our actions and instead encourage them to internalize our
          <strong>risk assessment</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than relying on speculation, well-designed transparency allows
          households, firms, and financial markets to understand:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>how we see the balance of risks,</li>
          <li>how uncertainty affects our decisions, and</li>
          <li>how we are likely to respond as new information arrives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          FPAS Mark II integrates transparency into the entire policy cycle—forecasts,
          scenarios, meetings, communication, and post-round evaluations—so that
          credibility is built through <strong>openness, clarity, and disciplined reasoning</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 2: DIMENSIONS OF TRANSPARENCY -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>2. Dimensions of Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          Transparency is multi-dimensional. Under FPAS Mark II, we emphasize several
          key dimensions that help the public understand not just the decision, but the
          <strong>framework and reasoning behind it</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Procedural transparency</strong> — explains <em>how decisions are made</em>:
            the structure of meetings, the process for deliberation, and how information
            flows to the Board.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytical transparency</strong> — explains the <em>models, scenarios, and
            evidence</em> we use: how we structure our forecasts and risk assessments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outcome transparency</strong> — presents <em>policy results clearly</em>:
            what happened to inflation, output, and other objectives relative to our
            projections and scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accountability transparency</strong> — attributes <em>reasoning and votes</em>:
            how individual members or the Board as a whole explain their positions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, these dimensions ensure that the public can see the full story:
          the framework, the analysis, the decision, and the ex post evaluation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 3: CBA TRANSPARENCY TOOLS -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>3. Transparency Tools at the Central Bank of Armenia</h2>
        <p>
          The Central Bank of Armenia uses a rich set of tools to put these principles
          into practice. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Attributed minutes</strong> that summarize the discussion and perspectives.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Individual votes and justifications</strong>, showing how each member
            assessed the risks and trade-offs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>Executive Statement</strong>, which provides a concise explanation
            of the decision and its rationale.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>Monetary Policy Report</strong>, which presents forecasts, scenarios,
            and the analytical backbone of the decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario-based communication</strong> that highlights alternative paths,
            risks, and trade-offs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Press conferences</strong> and <strong>analyst briefings</strong>, where Board
            members and staff answer questions and clarify how uncertainty is affecting
            decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These tools work together to clarify the Board’s reasoning under uncertainty
          and to show how FPAS Mark II is applied in practice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 4: SCENARIO-BASED COMMUNICATION AND UNCERTAINTY -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>4. Scenario-Based Communication and Uncertainty</h2>
        <p>
          Scenario-based communication is a powerful way to enhance transparency. By
          showing <strong>alternative paths, risks, and trade-offs</strong>, we move away from a
          single deterministic forecast and toward a more realistic portrayal of the
          <strong>distribution of risks</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Helps the public understand how different shocks could affect inflation,
            output, and financial conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Makes clear which risks the central bank is most concerned about and how
            policy might respond if those risks materialize.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengthens public trust and policy credibility by being honest about what
            we know and what we do not know.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By explaining both our <strong>central scenario</strong> and the <strong>key alternative
          scenarios</strong>, we support better decision-making in the private sector and
          more effective transmission of monetary policy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 5: TRANSPARENCY AS A FOUNDATION FOR CREDIBILITY -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>5. Transparency as a Foundation for Credibility</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, transparency is about more than documents and speeches. It is about
          how we <strong>earn credibility over time</strong>. By clearly explaining what we know,
          what we do not know, and how uncertainty affects our decisions, we invite the
          public to judge us on our <strong>reasoning and learning</strong>, not just on short-term
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          FPAS Mark II embeds transparency into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>its analytical processes,</li>
          <li>its communication strategy, and</li>
          <li>its institutional culture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this way, transparency becomes foundational. Credibility is not assumed;
          it is <strong>earned through openness, clarity, and disciplined reasoning</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
